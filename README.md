| Simple Edge Detection | - This code snippet provides a basic illustration of [edge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection). It begins by generating a 6x6 grayscale image with varying intensity values (20 for white and 10 for black). Next, a 3x3 edge detection kernel is applied to the image using the OpenCV function `cv2.filter2D`. This convolution operation highlights the edges in the original image, and the result is displayed in grayscale using `plt.imshow`.           | [SimpleEdgeDetection](https://github.com/Adrija-G/DigitalImageProcessing/blob/main/SimpleEdgeDetection.ipynb) |
